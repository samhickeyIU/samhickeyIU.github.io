  <h2>&emsp;Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    &ensp;"Anything that grows without limit, cannot exist." That is a quote 
    from my undergraduate calculus professor, Dr. Tilak Dealwis. What I find most interesting 
    about that quote is how applicable it is to other aspects of life. 
    From the largest animals to the smallest cells in our body, nothing 
    can grow limitlessly forever. When cells begin to replicate without limit 
    they are referred to cancerous cells, and if left unchecked, this 
    seemingly infinite growth will become the cells' ultimate demise. In 
    recent years we have found ways detect this disease using bone scans, 
    PET scans, CT scans, and many more, but today we're going to focus on an 
    automated method of detecting lung cancer in CT scans using deep learning. 

    <br><br>&ensp;At the heart of a neural network is a perceptron. Perceptrons 
    contain a set of weights by which a given input is multiplied by. Next, 
    these products are summed together and passed through an activation 
    function. Though Frank Rosenblatt designed only a single perceptron, 
    researchers over years found that by using more than one perceptron at a 
    time we are able to create non-linear functions that better fit our data. 
    However, a primary issue with these perceptrons is that they are 
    computationally expensive and for this reason, at their time of 
    introduction in 1957 researchers weren't able to tackle the problems 
    related to image processing that we will be looking at today. Each of these 
    networks comprise a larger network, but are made up of multiple 
    layers of the simple perceptron introduced by Rosenblatt. 
  </p>
  <h2>&emsp;The Model and Data</h2>
  <p>
    &ensp;Our network is trained on more than two thousand CT scans, and
    each scan is of the form (56x56x6). Additionally, we have three perspectives
    of each set of lungs. The first perspective views the lungs from the front, 
    as though you are looking at a person face-to-face. We refer to this perspective
    as the XY perspective. Next we have the XZ perspective. This image views the
    lungs from the side, as though you are facing a person's shoulder. Finally, 
    the YZ perspective view the lungs from above. Each CT scan is also accompanied 
    by a label indicating whether or not lungs contained a cancerous region. While 
    this is the data the network was trained on, our visualizations focus on the 
    weights or edges of the network since these are what allow us to learn about 
    what the network looks like. 

    <br><br>&ensp;Now that we have an understanding of how the data is structured, 
    we can discuss the model. Hierarchical deep-fusion learning takes these three 
    dimensional images from each individual perspective and sends them through a 
    set of networks before combining the output of each network and passing it into
    the final layer. Start with the XY perspective, we take each slice of the 3D 
    image such that we have a 2D image of the form (56x56). This means that for each 
    CT scan that is input to this XY-Slice model, we will receive six probabilities 
    indicating whether or not the image contains a tumor. Next, we will repeat this 
    process for both the XZ and YZ perspectives, training a new neural network for 
    each along the way. Before we move on to the next set of models, I would like to 
    mention that the input to these "slice" models contains 3136 pixels, however, 
    when developing the accompanying visualizations we found some limitations
    to the PyVis framework. For one, it takes nearly an hour for the process to 
    translate the data into an adjacency matrix since it does so in-place and not parallel. 
    Second, the Vis.js framework, upon which PyVis is built, fails to effeciently render 
    this many nodes at once. For these reasons we do not display the input layer at the 
    slice level, however, all other visualizations will contain their repsective input 
    nodes. We will go into more details on the caveats of PyVis and Vis.js along with 
    some possible alternatives, at the end of this article and the associated presentation.
    The next set of networks, referred to as the Plane networks, will pick up where the 
    last three left off. Each perspective will take in the six individual outputs all at 
    once and pass them through a series of layers before returning a single probability 
    for the given perspective as a whole. Finally, we have reached our Volume level 
    network. Instead of taking in six features, it will use each of the probabilities 
    from our prior networks, the XY, XZ, and YZ Plane, networks.

    <br><br>&ensp;Seems pretty simple, right? We're just passing the input from one 
    network to the next. But how do we decide how many nodes should be in each network? 
    What about the layers? How many layers should each network have? We set up 
    parameters to determine a minimum and maximum number of nodes and layers, and 
    from there the model will incrementally add nodes and layers comparing the performance 
    of each with the overall best performing model each iteration. If the new model 
    has more performance than it replaces the best model and is saved for later use,
    else the framework continues searching until the maximum parameteres are reached. 
    For this reason, you will notice that many of the models have unique shapes when 
    compared to one another. One of the more difficult tasks in deep learning is 
    developing an understanding for what these black-boxes are doing. Our visualizations 
    aim to provide insight to how each netowrk works at the perspective levels. 
    A particular point of interest is pruning. When certain weights are close to zero
    we can try removing them from the network in an attempt to improve efficiency, since
    they contribute so little to overall outcome.
  </p>
  <h2>&emsp;Problems, Caveats, and Improvements for the Future</h2>
  <p>
    &ensp;Initially, we had set out to simply view how certain data distributions change 
    the edges or weights of a neural network. However, it was brought to our attention 
    that we should likely look for a dataset that may be a bit more interesting. With 
    this in mind, we decided that it would be best to break down a complex neural network 
    in such a way that is both easy for a user to digest and useful to a researcher when 
    fine-tuning the network. Upon pivoting to this project, we quickly realized that 
    working with raw data to develop a structured graph made up of layers was far more 
    complicated than we had initially realized. We turned to NetworkX, a graphing 
    framework, to make designing each graph a bit easier. We were able to shrink 
    the size of the size of the 3136 input nodes for the slice layers such that the 
    visualization was digestable and at least somewhat pleasant to look at. However, 
    as we moved into the next stage of our project, developing dynamic visualizations, 
    we came across a fork in the road. NetworkX supports a myriad of frameworks for 
    developing dynamic, interactive visuals of graphs, two of which are D3 and PyVis. 
    D3 is solid, well-built framework with a strong community behind it and PyVis, on 
    the other hand, is an interesting framework built on the Vis.js api but has only a 
    small community. Since we had already had the opportunity to try D3, we decided 
    to give PyVis a chance... who knows, maybe it's a great framework that has just 
    yet to receive the same levels of recognition as D3. 

    <br><br>&ensp;After working with PyVis and its parent framework Vis.js, I can assure 
    you it is certainly not operating at the same caliber as D3. However, before you 
    write this little framework off to the bin, I would like to tell you about some what 
    it does really well. For starters, it has direct integration with NetworkX, 
    whereas D3 requires you to first dump your data to a json file before you can begin 
    working on your graph. Speaking of saving data, when it comes to NetworkX and D3, they are 
    on the ball! PyVis, on the other hand, lags behind a bit since there is no native way 
    to save your PyVis data to a json file, csv, parquet, or really any file other than an 
    html file. And even though the data is saved in this file, it's in a way trapped there 
    because it has already been dumped into Vis.js which also lacks a simple, native 
    data-saving feature. But as I said, it's not all bad! With PyVis and Vis.js we were 
    able to implement numerous hover and select events in relatively little time when 
    compared to D3. For example, in our visualizations when we hover over a node, after 
    200 ms we are shown the node's layer number and title, along with each of its associated 
    weights, which are listed in the same order that they appear. So as far as rapid 
    development goes, PyVis and Vis.js certainly win out over D3. But the little victories 
    end there. As I previously mentioned there came a point at which we realized this 
    little framework wouldn't be able to provide us with the tools we needed, such as 
    a popup box to clearly display the selected node name and all of its associated attributes. 
    Or when we decided it would make sense to provide our users with a color scale displaying 
    our cool color gradients that we had created in Python, we thought that the customizations 
    offered in D3 might also be available in Vis.js or PyVis, but alas, this little framework 
    had become our demise. Not only did PyVis and Vis.js not have a method for creating 
    our popup table or color scale, but they also had no way of allowing us to export our 
    data so that we could pick up in D3 where they had left off... Though we may not have been 
    able to provide all of the details that we desired, we were able to learn something about 
    all of these tools. As for PyVis and Vis.js, together they create a wonderful framework for 
    prototyping dynamic visualizations of graphs in particular. I could possibly even see myself 
    using PyVis during the development of these networks for a quick and easy visualization 
    to help develop my understanding of the network when fine-tuning. However, when it comes 
    to delivering a beautiful, full-featured visualization to clients or in preparation 
    for a public presentation, D3 and NetworkX are most certainly the best options.
